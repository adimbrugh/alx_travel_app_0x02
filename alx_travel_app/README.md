# project structure alx_travel_app
The alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on setting up the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating tools to ensure API documentation and maintainable configurations.

---

## 📦 Milestone 1 Project Reflection Summary:
Building a professional-grade Django REST API-based travel listing platform called alxtravelapp, with strong foundations in:

Scalable structure (project + app).
Clean dependency management.
Secure environment handling.
Robust API docs (Swagger).
Future-ready background tasks (Celery + RabbitMQ).
Git-based version control and public repository management.

These practices align very well with real-world backend engineering standards and will make the app easy to scale and maintain.

## 📦 Milestone 2 Create Database Modeling and Data Seeding – alx_travel_app_0x00

This task sets up the **core data models**, **API serializers**, and a **database seeder** for the `alx_travel_app_0x00` Django project. It is a foundational step in building a travel listing platform with sample data for development and testing.


## ✅ Objectives

1. Duplicate the project structure.
2. Define the database models: `Listing`, `Booking`, `Review`.
3. Create serializers for `Listing` and `Booking`.
4. Implement a management command to seed the database.
5. Populate the database with sample data using the seeder.

## 🚀 Milestone 3: Creating Views and API Endpoints

Base URL: `/api/`

| Endpoint              | Method | Description              |
|-----------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| /listings/            | GET    | List all listings        |
| /listings/            | POST   | Create new listing       |
| /listings/{id}/       | GET    | Get listing by ID        |
| /listings/{id}/       | PUT    | Update listing by ID     |
| /listings/{id}/       | DELETE | Delete listing by ID     |
| /bookings/            | GET    | List all bookings        |
| /bookings/            | POST   | Create new booking       |
| /bookings/{id}/       | GET    | Get booking by ID        |
| /bookings/{id}/       | PUT    | Update booking by ID     |
| /bookings/{id}/       | DELETE | Delete booking by ID     |

# 🚀 Milestone 4 – Chapa Payment Integration

## 📌 Objective
Integrate the **Chapa API** into the Django application to handle secure payments for bookings.  

This feature allows users to:
- Initiate payments when booking.
- Verify payment status.
- Update booking/payment records accordingly.

---

## 🛠 Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Model
Located in listings/models.py:
booking → ForeignKey to Booking
transaction_id → Unique Chapa transaction reference
amount → Payment amount
status → Pending, Completed, Failed

### 2. Payment API Endpoints
Implemented in listings/views.py:
POST /api/payments/initiate/ → Starts a payment with Chapa API and returns a payment link.
GET /api/payments/verify/<transaction_id>/ → Verifies payment status with Chapa and updates DB.

### 3. Payment Workflow
User books a listing.
System initiates a payment request to Chapa API.
Chapa returns a payment link → sent to user.
User completes payment.
System verifies payment and updates status.

### 4Testing the Payment Integration Using Chapa Sandbox
Go to Chapa Sandbox for test credentials.
Initiate payment and check the transaction status.

Example Test Request – Initiate Payment
POST /api/payments/initiate/
{
    "booking_id": 1,
    "amount": 500
}

Example Test Request – Verify Payment
GET /api/payments/verify/<transaction_id>/

# 🚀 Milestone 5 Background Task Management with Celery and Email Notifications

## Objective
Configure **Celery** with **RabbitMQ** to handle background tasks and implement an email notification feature for bookings in the `alx_travel_app_0x03` project.

## Setup
1. Start RabbitMQ:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --hostname rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
